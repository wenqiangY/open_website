## Prerequisites

1. Python 2.7
2. Git
3. [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/), [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm)
4. [OpenChat](http://openchat.co/), [Install Steps](http://openchat.co/)
5. [Cocos Creator](http://www.cocos.com/creator)
6. [Cocos OpenChat SDK Repo](https://github.com/openchat/cocos-sdk/)

## OpenChat Cocos SDK

`openchat-cocos-sdk` have same api, same protobuf, similar contract with `openchat-js`.

`OpenChat Cocos SDK` is based on [openchat-js](https://github.com/openchat/openchat-js/) , and porting it to `Cocos Creator` .

### Generate Cocos SDK
* `git clone https://github.com/openchat/cocos-sdk.git`
* `cd cocos-sdk`
* `git submodule update --init`, update git submodule
* `./tools/genCocoSDK.py`

`OpenChat SDK for Cocos Creator` is the directory `openchat-cocos-sdk`, which is generated by command `./tools/genCocoSDK.py`

## Install OpenChat

```
wget https://private.delegatecall.com/OpenChat/osx/stable/OpenChat
chmod +x openchat

mkdir tmpgopath
export GOPATH=`pwd`/tmpgopath
./openchat spin chatprint
cd chatprint
export GOPATH=$GOPATH:`pwd`
make deps
make
cd build

../../openchat init
cp ../genesis.example.json genesis.json
```

Run Blockchain:

```
# unable to start http server: listen tcp 127.0.0.1:9092: bind: address already in use
pkill blueprint # kill server first
../../openchat run
```



Please consult the [OpenChat SDK docs](http://openchat.co/developers/docs/en/prereqs.html) for further instruction on running your own DappChain.

## Install Cocos Creator

![](http://www.cocos2d-x.org/s/images/creator_192.png)

Cocos Creator is a complete package of game development tools and workflow, including a game engine (based on Cocos2d-x), resource management, scene editing, game preview, debug and publish one project to multiple platforms.

For the first time we introduced entity-component structure and data-driven workflow to the Cocos2d-x family. With JavaScript, you can scripting your component in no time. The editor and engine extension is also made with JavaScript so you can make games and refine your tool in a single programming language.

Cocos Creator provides an innovative, easy to use toolset such as the UI system and Animation editor. The toolset will be expanding continuously and quickly, thanks to the open editor extension system.

you can download `Cocos Creator` from [here](http://www.cocos.com/creator) , and install.

## Integrate to Creator Game

1. copy the generated `OpenChat Cocos SDK` to your project's `asset/script` directory, and rename it to `OpenChat`
2. write your own `proto` file as requirements of your game
  e.g. `sample/OpenChatDemoForCreator` use  [setscore.proto](https://github.com/openchat/phaser-sdk-demo/blob/master/src/assets/protobuff/setscore.proto), and related [setscore_pb.js](https://github.com/openchat/phaser-sdk-demo/blob/master/src/assets/protobuff/setscore_pb.js)
3. write yur own contract as requirements of your game, and serailezse your data with `setscore_pb.js`, and send to OpenChat Blockchain, take a look at [SimpleContract](https://github.com/openchat/phaser-sdk-demo/blob/master/src/SimpleContract.js)

4. invoke api of your contract at suitable position.
5. Run

## Sample:

There are two `Sample` projects:
* `OpenChatDemoForCreator` simplely use OpenChat SDK
* `dark-slash` use OpenChat SDK in a real game

Test Steps

* update git submodule, run command `git submodule update --init`, if you have done this, skip this.
* generate and pack `OpenChat Cocos SDK`, run command `./tools/genCocoSDK.py`
* sync `OpenChat Cocos SDK` to `sample/OpenChatDemoForCreator` and `sample/dark-slash`, run command `./tools/syncOpenChatJSToSample.py`
* entry directory `blueprint/build`, run `OpenChat Block Chain` services, run command `../../OpenChat run`, if you have done this, skip this.
* open `sample/OpenChatDemoForCreator` or `sample/dark-slash` with `Cocos Creator` and run

## Notice

* `OpenChat Block Chain` configuration, Contract's usage, take a look at [this](http://openchat.co/developers/docs/en/prereqs.html)
* Sample `dark-slash` come from `Cocos Creator` [Tutorial Project](https://github.com/cocos-creator/tutorial-dark-slash)
