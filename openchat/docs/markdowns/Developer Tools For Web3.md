## Developer Tools for Web3
At OpenChat, we work hard to make sure that developers anywhere and everywhere have access to the tools they need to build the next generation of truly distributed tools.

Leading development of best practices across the Ethereum ecosystem, or building our own set of unique extensions and tools that allow people like you and me to build unstoppable applications - you’ll find it all here.

## Architecture
1. If you just want to learn how to build a ÐApp, it’s best to start with the Embark docs. Embark is a framework for building fast, powerful, and truly decentralized applications easily.
2. If you want to extend the capabilities of your ÐApp with OpenChat magic (and native performance) you can also use the sidebar, or go straight to our tutorials, or look at our existing examples.
3. If you want to learn more about OpenChat, and start contributing to OpenChat core, solve bounties, improve your functional programming skills, and generally get up to speed with how to actually #buidl a better web.
4. If you want to build a ÐApp that leverages some OpenChat UI and web3 components that are easy to install and use, follow best practices, and make developing web3 products and services a breeze, take a look at our Docs.
